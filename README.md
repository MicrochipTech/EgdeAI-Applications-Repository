# Edge AI Applications Repository

This repository serves as the primary hub for Microchip‚Äôs Edge AI application portfolio. It highlights how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be efficiently deployed on resource-constrained MCUs, MPUs, and FPGAs, spanning real-world use cases across vision, audio, predictive maintenance, human‚Äìmachine interfaces (HMI), and electrical systems.

The objectives of this repository are to:

- Provide reusable reference applications that developers can adapt for their own designs
- Demonstrate best practices for deploying AI/ML models on Microchip platforms
- Showcase cross-platform support across dsPIC¬Æ, PIC32, SAM MPUs, and PolarFire¬Æ SoCs
- Act as a central knowledge base for development teams, customers, and ecosystem partners building Edge AI solutions

## üîπ Application Categories

### 1. Vision Applications
Vision is one of the fastest-growing areas in EdgeAI. These applications use cameras or image sensors to enable devices to see and interpret their environment.  
Typical challenges include **low-power image capture**, **real-time inference**, and **memory-efficient neural networks**.

Example use cases:
- **Smart Home**
- **Parking lot**
- face recognition
- Person detection
- Object recognition
- License Plate Detection

### 2. Audio Applications
Audio-based AI enables devices to listen, understand, and react to sound inputs. These solutions are highly relevant for **hands-free control, monitoring, and assistive technologies**.  
The main challenges are achieving **always-on low-power listening** and **robustness across noisy environments**.

Example use cases:
- **[Keyword spotting (KWS)](https://developerhelp.microchip.com/xwiki/bin/view/applications/machine-learning/edge-impulse-keyword-spotting/)** ‚Äì detecting short commands like ‚ÄúHey Microchip‚Äù or ‚ÄúStart‚Äù.  
- **[Sound recognition](https://developerhelp.microchip.com/xwiki/bin/view/applications/machine-learning/mlsound/)** ‚Äì recognizing events such as glass breaking, alarms, or machinery noise.  


---

### 3. Predictive Maintenance Applications
Predictive Maintenance (PdM) brings intelligence to industrial and IoT systems by monitoring equipment health in real-time. Instead of waiting for machines to fail, AI detects early signs of degradation, reducing downtime and cost.  
These applications often use **vibration, current, and acoustic signals** as inputs.

Example use cases:
- **[Fan Condition Monitoring](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/ml-Coffee-Powder-Brand-Classification-GasSensor)** ‚Äì identifying early signs of mechanical stress.  
- **Motor health monitoring** ‚Äì detecting imbalance, misalignment, or efficiency loss.  
- **Compressor condition monitoring** ‚Äì catching leaks or pressure drops before failure.

### 4. Human‚ÄìMachine Interface (HMI) Applications
HMI solutions enhance how users interact with devices by making interfaces more **natural, intuitive, and responsive**. AI-powered HMIs go beyond simple buttons, enabling **gesture, touchless, and multimodal interactions**.

Example use cases:
- **[Gesture recognition](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/ml-samd21-iot-mplabml-gestures-demo)** ‚Äì enabling gesture recognition in consumer electronics or automotive.  
- **[Gesture recognition using dsPIC](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/ml-samd21-iot-mplabml-gestures-demo)** ‚Äì gesture recognition on dsPIC device

### 5. Gas Sensing Applications

Gas and air-quality sensing is an emerging area in Edge AI where sensor fusion and machine learning enable devices to detect, classify, and respond to chemical signatures in real time. These applications can run on low-power MCUs and are relevant across industrial, consumer, and environmental domains.

Example use cases:

- **[Coffee bean classification](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/ml-Coffee-Powder-Brand-Classification-GasSensor)** ‚Äì distinguishing brands, roast level, freshness, or origin
---

### 6. Electrical Applications
Electrical signal monitoring is critical in industrial and residential environments. AI enhances traditional electrical sensing by detecting subtle patterns and anomalies that rule-based systems may miss.  
This category includes **safety, efficiency, and grid-monitoring applications**.

Example use cases:
- **Arc fault detection** ‚Äì identifying hazardous sparks in power lines or appliances.  
- **Load monitoring** ‚Äì tracking device-level consumption for energy efficiency.  
- **Smart metering & anomaly detection** ‚Äì predicting faults or abnormal electrical behavior.

7. Wearables & Activity Monitoring

This category includes motion, posture, gesture, and human-activity‚Äìbased Edge AI applications. These solutions typically use IMUs, accelerometers, or multimodal sensing to enable intelligent fitness, safety, and health monitoring on-device.

Example use cases:

- **[Smart Dumbbell](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/ml-PIC33CX-BZ2-and-WBZ451-IMU-SmartBell)** ‚Äì classifying reps, posture, and movement quality
- **[Fall Detection](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/ml-PIC33CX-BZ2-and-WBZ451-IMU-SmartBell)** ‚Äì detecting and alerting on human falls using embedded ML
